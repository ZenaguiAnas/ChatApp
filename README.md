## Best Practices

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ During the building of this application we used some best practices of **DESIGN PATTERNS** like Singleton and Observer and others.

- **`Singleton`**: ***Singleton***Â is a creationalÂ ***design pattern***Â that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

- **`Observer`**: **Observer**Â is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™reÂ observing.
